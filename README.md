# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.
The dataset used (creditcard.csv) contains 284,807 transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013, out of which 492 are fraudulent (0.172%). Since the dataset is highly imbalanced, the RandomOverSampler technique is applied to balance the classes.
